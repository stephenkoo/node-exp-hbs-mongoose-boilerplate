# NEHM Boilerplate

A boilerplate for building web apps using **Node.js, Express, Handlebars and Mongoose**.

I created this boilerplate to quickly set up projects with the modern and popular Node.js web framework (Express), templating engine (Handlebars), and MongoDB object modelling tool (Mongoose). The focus of this boilerplate is to be **lightweight and simple**.

Use the template files as a reference point for building your own Node.js models, controllers, views, and so on.

**Note:** The boilerplate will not work out of the box. Use it as a starting point for your project.

## Installation
