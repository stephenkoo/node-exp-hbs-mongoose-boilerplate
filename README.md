# NEHMF Boilerplate

A boilerplate for building web apps using **Node.js, Express, Handlebars, Mongoose, and Foundation**.

I created this boilerplate to quickly set up projects with the following modern and popular technologies:
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Node.js web framework
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) - Templating engine
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - MongoDB object modelling tool
- [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com) - Front-end framework

The focus of this boilerplate is to be **lightweight and simple**.
Use the template files as a reference point for building your own Node.js models, controllers, views, and so on.

**Note:** The boilerplate will not work out of the box. Use it as a starting point for your project.
